## What is express?

in simple terms express is a nodeJS frame work, where all of the stuff you would normally build from the ground up is aready serve for you to use, now this make express extremly flexible that it can be use to be run on server side aplication, and also api for micro services, this make express not only robust for a small app that does not need a full backend server but also really flexible in terms of use.

now the reason of popularity in express comes down to all of the fact ive listed so far, this framework can be seen use in many tech stack like MERN, MEAN, MEVAN, this is THE framework when it comes to nodeJS.

the reason that this is the framework for nodeJS is because Express simplified the process of HTTP request, and not only that express is a very unpinionated framework wich mean it can have diffrent ways to do the same things, include bare nececities, and also let us structure the folder however we want to, this is what makes express so flexible and well loved by the community.
